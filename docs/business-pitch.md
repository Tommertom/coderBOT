# VibeShip: Your AI-Powered Terminal in Your Pocket

## The Problem

Modern developers face a critical productivity challenge:

- **AI coding assistants are powerful** - GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude AI, Google Gemini, and Gemini can dramatically accelerate development
- **But they're trapped on your desktop** - You can't access them when you're away from your workstation
- **Remote development is clunky** - SSH, VPNs, and desktop remoting are slow, complex, and often blocked on mobile networks
- **Collaboration is fragmented** - Sharing terminal sessions and outputs requires screenshots, copy-paste, and screen sharing tools
- **Time is wasted** - Waiting to get back to your desk to run "just one quick command" or check on a build

## The Solution: VibeShip

**VibeShip transforms Telegram into your personal, AI-powered development terminal.**

Using your personal coderBOT (your automated coding assistant), you get instant access to your full development environment, complete with GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude AI, Google Gemini, Gemini CLI, or any command-line tool - directly from your phone, anywhere in the world.
