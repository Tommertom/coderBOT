## Problem Section

### Code Shouldn't Wait for a Desk

Modern developers face a productivity paradox:

- ❌ **AI tools are powerful** - but trapped on your desktop
- ❌ **Ideas strike anywhere** - but you can't code on the go
- ❌ **Emergencies don't wait** - yet you need a laptop to respond
- ❌ **Remote setups are clunky** - SSH, VPNs, and desktop remoting fail on mobile

**Time lost waiting to get back to your desk = opportunities missed.**
