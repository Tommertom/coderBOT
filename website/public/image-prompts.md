## Image Optimization Notes

After generating these images:
1. Optimize all JPG images at 80-85% quality
2. Use PNG for images requiring transparency
3. Consider WebP format for better compression
4. Create @2x versions for retina displays
5. Add lazy loading attributes in HTML

## Alternative: Icon Font or SVG Approach

1. Hero background
2. Mobile terminal mockup
3. One key feature illustration
